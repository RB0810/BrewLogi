Theme 3: Digital Empowerment
Problem Statement:
How do we ensure that fans can enjoy fresh beer - at the right place and at the right time at the Singapore Grand Prix? Have you ever organised a party / event and experienced challenges in buying groceries or drinks? How much beer do you need for a party of 30? Multiply that 10,000 please. For the Singapore Grand Prix, we need beer thatâ€™s fresh and cold for 300,000 people! How can we optimise the logistics and do things smarter? This one is for our HEINEKEN colleagues.

Target Industry: 
General/Global : 
Businesses that have large inventories and a vast customer-driven market who wish they can optimise sales, increase overall efficiency, and maximise labour productivity, ultimately leading to improved profitability and sustainable growth in a highly competitive industry.

Exclusive for Singapore Prix: 
Our aim is to provide event attendees who wish to purchase Heineken products from the stalls located at the zones, with a seamless and satisfactory customer experience, by offering to order online via BrewLogi to eliminate the concept of waiting in long queues.
Additionally, our aim is to empower event organisers and stall owners with digital tools, enabling them to efficiently manage their inventories and optimise sales for increased profitability.

Pain Points addressed: 
The app BrewLogi addresses several pain points for both customers and stall owners, including:

1. Tedious ordering process: BrewLogi offers a seamless ordering process for customers, eliminating the need for standing in long queues. Customers can browse stalls, select items, and order through the app, saving time and reducing frustration.

2. Age verification: The app's age confirmation feature ensures that only eligible customers can access and order alcoholic beverages, filtering out underage customers. This streamlines the ordering process and avoids unnecessary delays or issues related to age restrictions.

3. Inventory management: For organisers and stall owners, BrewLogi provides powerful inventory management tools. It allows organisers to track inventory levels, receive alerts when products are running low, and manage stall and client information effectively. This helps prevent stockouts, optimise ordering, and improve overall inventory control.

4. Performance insights and restock optimisation: The app provides valuable insights into sales trends and performance reviews. Organisers can analyse data to make data-driven decisions, such as optimising restock values, targeting specific audiences, and improving stall owners' profitability. These insights help organisers and stall owners make informed business decisions and enhance their operations.

5. Data visualisation: BrewLogi's advanced features, such as data visualisation, enhance the management and analysis of sales data. Visual representations of data in the form of pie charts and bar graphs, make it easier for organisers and stall owners to understand and interpret trends, patterns, and key metrics. This simplifies data analysis and supports more effective decision-making.

Overall, BrewLogi addresses pain points related to the ordering process, age verification, inventory management, performance insights and restock optimisation, and data visualisation for both customers and stall owners. It improves efficiency, saves time, enhances decision-making, and provides a more streamlined and enjoyable experience for all parties involved.

Future Plans
In order to enhance the functionality and user experience of the app in the future, several key features should be considered for implementation:
1. Notifications: Introduce a robust notification system that can deliver relevant updates and reminders to users, such as order status updates, promotional offers, and event announcements. The notifications can also be integrated on the organiser side to show specific stalls are low on stock or if some stall needs assistance/ more manpower, etc.
2. Cart Option: Incorporate a user-friendly cart feature that allows users to add multiple items from different vendors, facilitating a seamless and convenient ordering experience.
3. Discounts: Happy Hours: Implement a dynamic discount system, including happy hours or time-based promotions, to incentivize users and increase engagement during specific periods.
4. Integration with Payment Services: Enable integration with popular payment services to offer users a secure and convenient payment experience, supporting various payment methods and ensuring smooth transactions, avoiding the hassle of payment at counters altogether.
5. In-App Map Integration Based on Layout: Integrate a detailed map feature within the app, showcasing the event layout or venue map to help users easily navigate and locate specific stalls. Also, on the organiser side, this map will get updated if the organiser decided to add/remove a specific stall.
6. Past Order Details and Inventory Management: Incorporate an Order ID integration system that allows users to access their past order history, providing them with a detailed overview of their preferences and facilitating more accurate inventory management for each stall.
7. Pre-Ordering and Pick-Up: Introduce a pre-ordering feature that allows users to place orders in advance, specifying their preferred pick-up time, ensuring a smooth and efficient process for both users and organisers. This would ensure faster and more convenient transactions.
8. IoT Devices Integration: Explore the integration of IoT devices, such as smart shelves or digital signage, to enhance the overall app experience, optimise inventory management, and provide real-time updates on stall availability or promotional offers, avoiding the organisers to manually input inventory and stall numbers.
9. Layout Designer for Auto-Generation: Develop a layout designer tool for event organisers, enabling them to create and customise the stall map layout automatically. This feature would streamline the process of setting up stalls for different events and provide organisers with greater flexibility and control.
Implementing these features will significantly improve the app's functionality, user engagement, and overall user satisfaction, making it a more comprehensive and valuable tool for both users and event organisers.
